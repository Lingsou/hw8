For the Final Project, im thinking of doing a different type of pong game. WHich there will be severals block on the top of 
the screen and a ball bounceing around the border. Player have to control the bar at the bottom of the screen to prevent the
ball hitting the bottom line and try to bounce the ball back to hit the block on the top. There will be a bar on the top left
and right corner to show player's score and life. And if they did not bounce the ball back it would the end game.
